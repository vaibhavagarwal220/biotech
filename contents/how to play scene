The game is based upon DNA translation in eukaryotes. You have got a mRNA chain and you have to summon the required codons by selecting its triplet nucleic acids.
Remember the possible pairing 
A-U
G-C

The game has two modes
1. Best time mode-You have to select no of amino acids present in your protein, and try to complete it in best time.
2.Race Against time-You have to select time duration and make the longest chain protein in that time.

You have got 3 lives to complete any mode.Remember each wrong choice of nucleic acid costs you a life.Have fun.
