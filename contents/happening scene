Proteins
You encounter so many  proteins in day-to-day life that they seem countless to number:
e.g.
//insert photos of examples
Oxyhaemoglobin(transportation)
Pepsin(catalysts)
Insulin(transfer of information)

All these proteins are made inside the cell using a process called protein synthesis.
Protein synthesis has two steps:
 //insert  photos of transcription and translation
//insert a phto eukaryotic and prokaryotic 
1.Transcription:Transcription is the first step of gene expression, in which a particular segment of DNA is copied into RNA (especially mRNA) by the enzyme RNA polymerase During transcription, a DNA sequence is read by an RNA polymerase, which produces a complementary, antiparallel RNA strand called a primary transcript.
2.Translation :In molecular biology and genetics, translation is the process in which cellular ribosomes create proteins.In translation, messenger RNA (mRNA)—produced by transcription from DNA—is decoded by a ribosome to produce a specific amino acid chain, or polypeptide.

In this app we are showing translation process happening inside eukaryotes.
